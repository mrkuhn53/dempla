This directory contains sample assemblies, which can be used
as "startfiles" in an OVAL simulation.  The samples are given in the 
ASCII D-file format.  The primary attributes of these assemblies 
are as follows:

Each assembly is roughly square (or cubical) and with an isotropic fabric.
They were created by isotropically compressing a sparse assembly with
friction turned off.  The assemblies contain a range of particles sizes.
The dimensions of the particles and the entire assemblies have
been scaled so that the mean particle size $D_{50}$ in each assembly is 1.00.
(Here, we speak of the mean particle size $D_{50}$ in the usual sense
of geotechnical engineering:  a ``median'' diameter that partitions
the assembly into two sets of particles, so that each set has an equal
cumulative mass.) The aspect ratio of non-circular particles in the 2D 
assemblies of ellipses and ovals is uniformly distributed between
1.05 and 1.40, where the aspect ratio is 
$r_{\mathrm{major}} / r_{\mathrm{minor}}$.
%
The void ratio is a measure of the packing density of 
a granular assembly.  The assemblies of circles and spheres are fairly 
dense for such particle shapes.  Both loose and dense assemblies of 
ovals are provided.  The coordination numbers shown are computed as
twice the number of contacts divided by the number of particles).
Among the attributes listed, the dimensionless overlap probably 
has the greatest effect on the speed and performance of a simulation.
The dimensionless overlaps, which are quite small, were computed
by dividing the average overlap at particle contacts by the
mean particle size, $D_{50}$.  Small overlaps more closely resemble 
those in real granular materials, which are often composed of hard granules.
During simulations, however, small overlaps
require slower deformation rates to assure the near quasi-static
progression of particle rearrangements.

Note that the older Dcircls_1002 and Dcircls_4008 have been removed,
since they were somewhat anisotropic.
%
The directory Series_circls_1002 contains an entire series of assemblies
of 1002 circular particles, each having the same void ratio and the same
particle sizes, but different particle arrangements.
