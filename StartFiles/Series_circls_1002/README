This directory contains an entire series of assemblies of 1002 circular 
particles, each having the same void ratio and the same particle sizes, 
but different particle arrangements.

The void ratios are all 0.174257.

I have included the bash script files, the Runfiles, and several Fortran
programs that were used to create these files.

The process is as follows:
  1) start with the 1002 circular 2D particles (in a very dense assembly).
  2) "shuffle" the particle diameters.  That is, I use the same particle
diameters, but assign the diameters to different particles (the original
1002 diameters were randoly distributed).  This "shuffling" will of course
cause some of the particles to greatly overlap.  So ....
  3) Expand the periodic boundaries by a factor of 3.  This eliminates all
of the overlaps between the particles.  But, of course, the assembly is
now VERY loose, like a gas.
  4) Turn off friction and compact the assembly using the OVAL program.
This process take 13 steps.  The first steps are very rapid compression.
The final steps are very, very slow compression so that many contacts can
be formed.  I learned a lot about doing this while preparing the 3D ovoid
assemblies.
  5) Do steps 1-4 again and again, creating one new assembly with every
loop.

The process creates completely different particle arrangements, but with
the exact same distribution of particle diameters and the exact same void
ratio.  There are some differences in the final number of contacts and the
final stress, but it is impossible to get everything the same.
