  volume = {60},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a new general solution to the fundamental
	problem of frictional contact of two elastic spheres, also known
	as the Hertz-Mindlin (HM) problem. The description of spheres in
	contact is a central topic in contact mechanics. It became a foundation
	of many applications, such as the friction of rough surfaces and
	the mechanics of granular materials and rocks, etc. Moreover, it
	serves as a theoretical background in modern nonlinear acoustics
	and elasticity, e.g. seismology and nondestructive testing. However,
	despite many efforts, a rigorous analytical solution for the general
	case when arbitrary normal and tangential forces are present is still
	missing, mainly because the traction distribution within the contact
	zone is convoluted and hardly tractable, even under relatively simple
	external action. Here, accepting a number of traditional limitations
	such as 2D loading and the existence of a functional dependence between
	normal and tangential forces, we propose an original way of replacing
	the complex traction distributions by simple graphical counterparts
	called memory diagrams, and we formulate a procedure that enables
	initiating and maintaining these memory diagrams following an arbitrary
	loading history. For each memory diagram, the solution can be expressed
	by closed-form analytical formulas that we have derived using known
	techniques suggested by Mindlin, Deresiewicz, and others. So far,
	to the best of our knowledge, arbitrary loading histories have been
	treated only numerically. Implementation of the proposed memory diagram
	method provides an easy-to-use computer-assisted analytical solution
	with a high level of generality. Examples and results illustrate
	the variety and richness of effects that can be encountered in a
	geometrically simple system of two contacting spheres. },

  number = {4},
  abstract = {In this paper we apply the Preisach hysteretic formalism to the Hertz-Mindlin
	system dealing with frictional and elastic interactions of two spheres
	in contact subjected to a varying oblique force. The classical solution
	for this fundamental mechanical problem, obtained by Mindlin and
	Deresiewicz over 50 years ago, has become the foundation for many
	applications, including friction of rough surfaces, physics of granular
	materials, rock mechanics, nonlinear acoustics, seismology, geological
	exploration, monitoring of oil reservoirs and mining processes, etc.
	However, due to the complex nature of the general case of a two-sphere
	interaction subjected to an arbitrary force protocol, researchers
	have commonly utilized only the basic results of the Hertz-Mindlin
	theory, i.e. the formulations of the normal and tangential stiffnesses
	and of the hysteretic loss of energy. The full description with arbitrarily
	varying forces has been possible only on a case-to-case basis. To
	overcome this hurdle, we propose to link the Hertz-Mindlin system
	to the fundamental theory introduced by Preisach over 70 years ago,
	which provides the tools to mathematically describe arbitrary hysteretic
	functions, i.e. non-unique and history-dependent functional relations
	with irreversible behavior. We show how the Preisach formalism simplifies
	the mathematical complexity of the Hertz-Mindlin problem and makes
	it possible to consider complicated force protocols in a universal
	manner. We prove that the Hertz-Mindlin interaction with dN/dT=const
	is a particular case of a Preisach system and we derive the essential
	parameters of the corresponding Preisach formalism. Finally, we demonstrate
	the analogy between force-driven systems and displacement-driven
	systems, and we propose a new solution for the displacement-driven
	Hertz-Mindlin friction. },

  abstract = {I present a method to simulate complex-shaped interacting bodies,
	a problem which appears in many areas, including molecular dynamics,
	material science, virtual reality, geo- and astrophysics. The particle
	shape is represented by the classical concept of a Minkowski sum,
	which permits the representation of complex shapes without the need
	to define the object as a composite of spherical or convex particles.
	A well-defined conservative and frictional interaction between these
	bodies is derived. The model (particles+interactions) is much more
	efficient, accurate and easier to implement than other models. Simulations
	with conservative interactions comply with the statistical mechanical
	principles for conservative systems. Simulations with frictional
	forces show that particle shape strongly affects the jamming phenomena
	in granular flow.}

	the discrete-continuum duality of granular matter. Grain-scale kinematics,
	obtained by shearing a sample under triaxial compression, are coupled
	with a recently proposed multiscale computational framework to model
	the behavior of the material without resorting to phenomenological
	evolution (hardening) laws. By doing this, complex material behavior
	is captured by extracting the evolution of key properties directly
	from the grain-scale mechanics and injecting it into a continuum
	description (e.g., elastoplasticity). The effectiveness of the method
	is showcased by two examples: one linking discrete element computations
	with finite elements and another example linking a triaxial compression
	experiment using computed tomography and digital image correlation
	with finite element computation. In both cases, dilatancy and friction
	are used as the fundamental plastic variables and are obtained directly
	from the grain kinematics. In the case of the result linked to the
	experiment, the onset and evolution of a persistent shear band is
	modeled, showing—for the first time—three-dimensional multiscale
	results in the post-bifurcation regime with real materials and good
	quantitative agreement with experiments. },

	method (DEM) capable of accurately capturing grain shape by using

	take realistic and complex granular shapes encountered in engineering

	computational models where particle shape is realistically modeled.
	It is expected that, with the rapid advancement of computational
	power, combining high-fidelity characterization with physics-based
	computations will lead to more predictive modeling approaches. The

	are only dependent on the magnitude-equivalent number of cycles relationship.
	These factors are compared with others based on laboratory cyclic
	strengths from Seed and Idriss and on statistical regression of data

	the limitations and extrapolations of the laboratory-based derivation
	by Seed and Idriss, and they are recommended for use in the analysis

	The effect of particle shape is analyzed by comparing the polyhedra

	stress and dilatancy but similar stress-dilatancy relation compared
	to the sphere packing. A harmonic approximation of granular fabric
	is presented in terms of branch vectors (connecting particle centers)
	and contact force components along and perpendicular to the branch
	vectors. It is found that the origin of enhanced shear strength of
	the polyhedra packing lies in its higher force anisotropy with respect
	to the sphere packing which has a higher fabric anisotropy. Various
	contact types (face-vertex, face-face, etc.) contribute differently
	to force transmission and fabric anisotropy. In particular, most
	face-face contacts belong to strong force chains along the major

	the contact dynamics method. The particle shapes are rounded-cap
	rectangles characterized by their elongation. The macroscopic and
	microstructural properties of several packings subjected to biaxial
	compression are analyzed as a function of particle elongation. We
	find that the shear strength is an increasing linear function of
	elongation. Performing an additive decomposition of the stress tensor
	based on a harmonic approximation of the angular dependence of branch
	vectors, contact normals, and forces, we show that the increasing
	mobilization of friction force and the associated anisotropy are
	key effects of particle elongation. These effects are correlated
	with partial nematic ordering of the particles which tend to be oriented
	perpendicular to the major principal stress direction and form side-to-side
	contacts. However, the force transmission is found to be mainly guided
	by cap-to-side contacts, which represent the largest fraction of
	contacts for the most elongated particles. Another interesting finding
	is that, in contrast to shear strength, the solid fraction first
	increases with particle elongation but declines as the particles
	become more elongated. It is also remarkable that the coordination
	number does not follow this trend so that the packings of more elongated
	particles are looser but more strongly connected.},

	utilized to obtain the average balance equations for granular materials.
	The method is applicable to both solid-like (quasi-static) and fluid-like
	(granular flow) modes of granular material behavior. The average
	balance equations take the same mathematical form while all average
	quantities involved in these equations retain the same clear physical
	meaning whether or not the continuum hypothesis is satisfied. If
	it is, the average variables are continuous and smooth functions
	of space and time and are independent of the averaging length and
	time scales. Otherwise, the average variables may be discontinuous
	and scale-dependent, but the same average balance equations hold
	within the framework of calculus of generalized functions. The results
	include explicit expressions which can be used for calculation of
	the average quantities involved in the theory in terms of the microscopic
	‘observables’ that may be available from the discrete element simulations.

	embedded in the model, which is also apt to describe contractant
	and dilatant behaviour. The adaptation of various predefined limit
	conditions with smooth and conical critical stress surfaces is outlined
	in detail. For large deformations with rotations of the principal
	axes, the objective stress rate given by Green and Naghdi is proposed
	instead of the objective stress rate given by Zaremba and Jaumann.
	Finally, the response of the constitutive equation for large shearing

  abstract = { We discuss the microstates of compressed granular matter in terms
	of two independent ensembles: one of volumes and another of boundary
	force moments. The former has been described in the literature and
	gives rise to the concept of compactivity: a scalar quantity that
	is the analogue of temperature in thermal systems. The latter ensemble
	gives rise to another analogue of the temperature: an angoricity
	tensor. We discuss averages under either of the ensembles and their
	relevance to experimental measurements. We also chart the transition
	from the microcanoncial to a canonical description for granular materials
	and show that one consequence of the traditional treatment is that
	the well-known exponential distribution of forces in granular systems
	subject to external forces is an immediate consequence of the canonical
	distribution, just as in the microcanonical description E = H leads
	to exp (−H/kT). We also put this conclusion in the context of observations
	of nonexponential forms of decay. We then present a Boltzmann-equation
	and Fokker−Planck approaches to the problem of diffusion in dense
	granular systems. Our approach allows us to derive, under simplifying
	assumptions, an explicit relation between the diffusion constant
	and the value of the hitherto elusive compactivity. We follow with
	a discussion of several unresolved issues. One of these issues is
	that the lack of ergodicity prevents convenient translation between
	time and ensemble averages, and the problem is illustrated in the
	context of diffusion. Another issue is that it is unclear how to
	make use in the statistical formalism the emerging ability to exactly
	predict stress fields for given structures of granular systems. },

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new volume function for calculation of the entropy
	of planar granular assemblies. This function is extracted from the
	antisymmetric part of a new geometric tensor and is rigorously additive
	when summed over grains. It leads to the identification of a conveniently
	small phase space. The utility of the volume function is demonstrated
	on several case studies, for which we calculate explicitly the mean

  pages = {997--1018},

  abstract = {Some of the most challenging problems in geomechanics involve the
	coupling between fluid flow and solid deformation. In this paper
	we briefly present an overview of existing coupling methods to problems
	involving fluid flow and deformation and describe testing of a new
	discrete-based coupling method for problems in porous media. Modeled
	permeability and porosity distributions are compared to idealized
	packed assemblies and results are presented for simulations of steady
	flow through porous media. Previously published results for the coupled
	model focused on few or multiple particles in a fluid, whereas our
	results show good agreement to packed assemblies of particles (i.e.
	porous media). Finally, the two-dimensional model is applied to sand
	production, a common problem in geomechanics. Sand production is
	defined as the co-production of both a fluid and solid phase in oil
	and gas wells. In our models, we capture initial sand production
	associated with early-time drawdown. Later-time results show episodic
	sanding rates associated with formation stability and instabilities.
	Both observations are qualitatively consistent with laboratory and
	field observations. We find that high confining pressure inhibits
	the production of sand, through elevated interparticle contact forces.
	It is argued that these physically based models have a use in testing
	and evaluating competing hypotheses of sand production but their
	applicability is currently limited to small spatial and temporal
	scales. We believe these models bridge an important gap between the
	underlying physics of micro-mechanical interactions of fluid and
	solid grains and the continuum descriptions of those systems. Copyright

  abstract = {This paper describes an experimental study examining the influence
	of the mechanical and geometrical properties of the constituent grains
	on the overall material response of cohesionless granular materials.
	Glass ballotini were used as an analogue soil; their relatively simple
	geometry allowed the influence of particle shape and inter-particle
	friction to be examined independently. Techniques were developed
	to control the surface roughness of the ballotini to facilitate a
	parametric study. The particle shape was also varied by crushing
	the ballotini. At the micro-scale, the particle characterisation
	included accurate measurements of inter-particle friction, contact
	stiffness, particle surface roughness and particle shape. At the
	macro-scale the sensitivity of overall material response to changes
	in surface roughness and geometry was characterised using triaxial
	tests and oedometer tests on smooth spherical ballotini, roughened
	ballotini and crushed angular ballotini. Compression tests indicated
	that the initial load deformation response at particle-particle contact
	points is significantly softer than previously believed. Optical
	interferometry of particles after single particle-particle shearing
	tests confirmed that plastic strains occurred at the contact point,
	which were related to plastic yield. A Hertzian response was only
	seen at higher contact loads. A clear relationship between the inter-particle
	friction and the particle surface roughness was found. However, the
	macro-scale experiments indicated that while the material response
	may be slightly dependent on the surface roughness and friction,
	the influence of particle shape is very much more significant.},

  abstract = {Discrete element method (DEM) models to simulate laboratory element
	tests play an important role in advancing our understanding of the
	mechanics of granular material response, including bonded or cemented,
	particulate materials. Comparisons of the macro-scale response observed
	in a real physical test and a #virtual# DEM-simulated test can calibrate
	or validate \{DEM\} models. The detailed, particle scale information
	provided in the \{DEM\} simulation can then be used to develop our
	understanding of the material behaviour. It is important to accurately
	model the physical test boundary conditions in these \{DEM\} simulations.
	This paper specifically considers triaxial tests as these tests are
	commonly used in soil mechanics. In a triaxial test, the test specimen
	of granular material is enclosed within a flexible latex membrane
	that allows the material to deform freely during testing, while maintaining
	a specified stress condition. Triaxial tests can only be realistically
	simulated in 3D \{DEM\} codes, however analogue, 2D, biaxial \{DEM\}
	simulations are also often considered as it is easier to visualize
	particle interactions in two dimensions. This paper describes algorithms
	to simulate the lateral boundary conditions imposed by the latex
	membrane used in physical triaxial tests in both 2D and 3D \{DEM\}
	simulations. The importance of carefully considering the lateral
	boundary conditions in \{DEM\} simulations is illustrated by considering
	a 2D biaxial test on a specimen of frictional unbonded disks and
	a 3D triaxial test on a bonded (cemented) specimen of spheres. The
	comparisons indicate that the lateral boundary conditions have a
	more significant influence on the local, particle-scale response
	in comparison with the overall macro-scale observations. },

  abstract = {The development of reliable discrete element models to simulate the
	mechanics of granular media requires knowledge of the grain-to-grain
	contact laws of the material in question. We have conducted a series
	of normal and sliding contact experiments on material used in laboratory
	triaxial experiments to obtain such contact laws for DEM simulations
	of the experiments. The contact experiments employed segments of
	14.72 mm-diameter spherical grains from the triaxial specimens and
	flat specimens of the same material. The spherical grains had a uniform
	diameter with a smooth surface finish. Monotonic and cyclic loading
	paths were applied in both the normal and sliding modes, and both
	sphere-sphere and sphere-flat contact behavior were examined. Force-displacement
	behavior and frictional loss were measured in all cases. The behavior
	was generally Hertzian in the normal contact experiments, which involved
	forces up to approximately 100 N. The normal contact stiffness increased
	from ≈2 to 15MN m −1 over the range of normal force examined. The
	sliding experiments employed several normal forces up to approximately
	25 N, and produced a value of the coefficient of static friction
	of 0.28. The shear stiffness of the sliding contact increased with
	normal force, and ranged from 0.8 to 1.2MN m −1 under normal loads
	ranging from ≈1 to 7.5 N, respectively, for virgin contacts. The
	shear stiffness observed for the sphere-flat contact decreased with
	wear. Surface roughness measurements were obtained on both tested
	and untested regions of the spheres and flat specimens. The average
	roughness (Ra) for untested regions of the sphere and flat specimens
	were 270 and 230 nm, respectively. Repeated testing in the sliding
	mode reduced these values by 29-45\% for the flat surfaces, and by
	20\% for the spherical contact. Frictional losses were observed in
	both the normal and sliding modes. In the sliding mode, frictional
	loss decreased with increasing normal load. We observed stable sliding
	(associated with significant contact movement under an increasing
	shear force) at forces that were below the macroscopic frictional
	limit and resulted in permanent displacement of the contact. There
	was generally a distinct threshold in shear force for this permanent
	sliding. The extent of sliding increased significantly with wear
	for the sphere-flat contact and was accompanied by a substantial
	drop in shear stiffness.},

	The reformulation of previous work, in which the Helmholtz free energy

	Comments are made on elastic-plastic coupling. Implications of the

	in a full-scale test of a sloping saturated fine sand deposit, representative
	of liquefiable, young alluvial and hydraulic fill sands in the field.
	The test was conducted using a 6-m tall inclined laminar box shaken
	at the base. At the end of shaking, nearly the whole deposit was
	liquefied, and the ground surface displacement had reached 32 cm.
	The presented analysis of lateral spreading mechanics utilizes a
	unique set of lateral displacement results, from three independent
	techniques. One of these techniques—motion tracking analysis of the
	experiment video recording—is especially useful as it produced time
	histories for all laminar box rings and a complete picture of the
	lateral spreading initiation with an unprecedented degree of resolution
	in time and space. A systematic study of the data identifies the
	progressive stages of initiation and accumulation of lateral spreading,
	lateral spread contribution of various depth ranges and sliding zones,
	their relation to the simultaneous pore pressure buildup, and the
	soil shear strength response during sliding. },

  volume = {72},
  pages = {783--803},
  number = {3},
  abstract = { Abstract For the stability of agglomerates of micron sized particles
	it is of considerable importance to study the effects of tangential
	forces on the contact of two particles. If the particles can slide
	or roll easily over each other, fractal structures of these agglomerates
	will not be stable. We use the description of contact forces by Johnson,
	Kendall and Roberts, along with arguments based on the atomic structure
	of the surfaces in contact, in order to calculate the resistance
	to rolling in such a contact. It is shown that the contact reacts
	elastically to torque forces up to a critical bending angle. Beyond
	that, irreversible rolling occurs. In the elastic regime, the moment
	opposing the attempt to roll is proportional to the bending angle
	and to the pull-off force P c . Young's modulus of the involved materials
	has hardly any influence on the results. We show that agglomerates
	of sub-micron sized particles will in general be quite rigid and
	even long chains of particles cannot be bent easily. For very small
	particles, the contact will rather break than allow for rolling.
	We further discuss dynamic properties such as the possibility of
	vibrations in this degree of freedom and the typical amount of rolling
	during a collision of two particles. },

  abstract = {A variational formulation is employed to derive a micromechanics-based,
	explicit nonlocal constitutive equation relating the ensemble averages
	of stress and strain for a class of random linear elastic composite
	materials. For two-phase composites with any isotropic and statistically
	uniform distribution of phases (which themselves may have arbitrary
	shape and anisotropy), we show that the leading-order correction
	to a macroscopically homogeneous constitutive equation involves a
	term proportional to the second gradient of the ensemble average
	of strain. This nonlocal constitutive equation is derived in explicit
	closed form for isotropic material in the one case in which there
	exists a well-founded physical and mathematical basis for describing
	the material's statistics: a matrix reinforced (or weakened) by a
	random dispersion of nonoverlapping identical spheres. By assessing,
	when the applied loading is spatially-varying, the magnitude of the
	nonlocal term in this constitutive equation compared to the portion
	of the equation that relates ensemble average stresses and strains
	through a constant “overall” modulus tensor, we derive quantitative
	estimates for the minimum representative volume element (RVE) size,
	defined here as that over which the usual macroscopically homogeneous
	“effective modulus” constitutive models for composites can be expected
	to apply. Remarkably, for a maximum error of 5% of the constant “overall”
	modulus term, we show that the minimum RVE size is at most twice
	the reinforcement diameter for any reinforcement concentration level,
	for several sets of matrix and reinforcement moduli characterizing
	large classes of important structural materials. Such estimates seem
	essential for determining the minimum structural component size that
	can be treated by macroscopically homogeneous composite material
	constitutive representations, and also for the development of a fundamentally-based
	macroscopic fracture mechanics theory for composites. Finally, we
	relate our nonlocal constitutive equation explicitly to the ensemble
	average strain energy, and show how it is consistent with the stationary
	energy principle.},

  abstract = {A novel three-dimensional particle-based technique utilizing the discrete
	element method is proposed to analyze the seismic response of soil-foundation-structure
	systems. The proposed approach is employed to investigate the response
	of a single-degree-of-freedom structure on a square spread footing
	founded on a dry granular deposit. The soil is idealized as a collection
	of spherical particles using discrete element method. The spread
	footing is modeled as a rigid block composed of clumped particles,
	and its motion is described by the resultant forces and moments acting
	upon it. The structure is modeled as a column made of particles that
	are either clumped to idealize a rigid structure or bonded to simulate
	a flexible structure of prescribed stiffness. Analysis is done in
	a fully coupled scheme in time domain while taking into account the
	effects of soil nonlinear behavior, the possible separation between
	foundation base and soil caused by rocking, the possible sliding
	of the footing, and the dynamic soil-foundation interaction as well
	as the dynamic characteristics of the superstructure. High fidelity
	computational simulations comprising about half a million particles
	were conducted to examine the ability of the proposed technique to
	model the response of soil-foundation-structure systems. The computational
	approach is able to capture essential dynamic response patterns.
	The cyclic moment-rotation relationships at the base center point
	of the footing showed degradation of rotational stiffness by increasing
	the level of strain. Permanent deformations under the foundation
	continued to accumulate with the increase in number of loading cycles.

  abstract = {This paper presents essential numerical procedures in the context
	of the coupled lattice Boltzmann (LB) and discrete element (DE) solution
	strategy for the simulation of particle transport in turbulent fluid
	flows. Key computational issues involved are (1) the standard LB
	formulation for the solution of incompressible fluid flows, (2) the
	incorporation of large eddy simulation (LES)-based turbulence models
	in the LB equations for turbulent flows, (3) the computation of hydrodynamic
	interaction forces of the fluid and moving particles; and (4) the
	DE modelling of the interaction between solid particles. A complete
	list is provided for the conversion of relevant physical variables
	to lattice units to facilitate the understanding and implementation
	of the coupled methodology. Additional contributions made in this
	work include the application of the Smagorinsky turbulence model
	to moving particles and the proposal of a subcycling time integration
	scheme for the DE modelling to ensure an overall stable solution.
	A particle transport problem comprising 70 large particles and high
	Reynolds number (around 56 000) is provided to demonstrate the capability
	of the presented coupling strategy. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &

  abstract = {A general method called \{FE2\} has been introduced which consists
	in describing the behavior of heterogeneous structures using a multiscale
	finite element model. Instead of trying to build differential systems
	to establish a stress-strain relation at the macroscale, a finite
	element computation of the representative volume element is carried
	out simultaneously. Doing so does not require any constitutive equations
	to be written at the macroscopic scale: all non-linearities come
	directly from the microscale. In this paper, we describe how this
	method can be used in the context of generalized continua. For such
	continua, constitutive equations are very difficult to write, and
	a new set of material is difficult to fit to experimental data. The
	use of \{FE2\} models bypasses this problem because no analytical
	equation is needed at the macroscale. An academic application is
	presented to show that generalized continua are necessary when the
	size of the heterogeneities increases, and that \{FE2\} models behave
	well compared to a reference solution. },

	additional degrees of freedom accounting for volume changes, rotation
	and straining of an underlying microstructure. An increase in the
	number of degrees of freedom represents a refinement of the material
	description. In addition to available nonlinear Cosserat and micromorphic
	theories, general formulations of elastoviscoplastic behaviour are
	proposed for microdilatation and microstretch continua. A microstrain
	theory is introduced that is based on six additional degrees of freedom
	describing the pure straining of the microstructural element. In
	each case, balance equations and boundary conditions are derived,
	decompositions of the finite strain measures into elastic and plastic
	parts are provided. The formulation of finite deformation elastoviscoplastic
	constitutive equations relies on the introduction of the free energy
	and dissipation potentials, thus complying with requirements of continuum
	thermodynamics. Some guidelines for the selection of a suitable higher
	order model for a given material close the discussion. },

	and torsion friction coefficients together with their associated
	length scales. Interestingly, even though normal contacts behave
	elastically (Hertzian), all other modes of motion display effects
	due to surface roughness and consequent plastic deformation. The
	influence of adhesion is interpreted in the framework of different
	models and is very different for different degrees of freedom, being
	largest for rolling.},

  pages = {300--319},
  number = {1442},
  abstract = {It is usually assumed that the real area of contact between two nominally
	flat metal surfaces is determined by the plastic deformation of their
	highest asperities. This leads at once to the result that the real
	area of contact is directly proportional to the load and independent
	of the apparent area-a result with many applications in the theories
	of electric contacts and friction. Archard pointed out that plastic
	deformation could not be the universal rule, and introduced a model
	which showed that, contrary to earlier ideas, the area of contact
	could be proportional to the load even with purely elastic contact.
	This paper describes a new theory of elastic contact, which is more
	closely related to real surfaces than earlier theories. We show how
	the contact deformation depends on the topography of the surface,
	and establish the criterion for distinguishing surfaces which touch
	elastically from those which touch plastically. The theory also indicates
	the existence of an {\textquoteright}elastic contact hardness{\textquoteright},
	a composite quantity depending on the elastic properties and the
	topography, which plays the same role in elastic contact as the conventional
	hardness does in plastic contact. A new instrument for measuring
	surface topography has been built; with it the various parameters
	shown by the theory to govern surface contact can be measured experimentally.
	The typical radii of surface asperities have been measured. They
	were found, surprisingly, to be orders of magnitude larger than the
	heights of the asperities. More generally we have been able to study
	the distributions of asperity heights and of other surface features
	for a variety of surfaces prepared by standard techniques. Using
	these data we find that contact between surfaces is frequently plastic,
	as usually assumed, but that surfaces which touch elastically are
	by no means uncommon in engineering practice.},

  abstract = {A unified framework for coupled elastoplastic and damage theories
	is developed. A rigorous thermodynamic procedure is followed that
	is sufficiently general to include anisotropic plasticity and anisotropic
	damage formulations. The concept of effective stress is the critical
	mechanism for coupling these theories. Yield and damage functions,
	constructed of homogeneous functions of degree one, are shown to
	satisfy thermodynamic restrictions. The principle of maximum entropy
	provides the evolutionary relations, the loading and unloading conditions,
	and the convexity of the undamaging elastic domain. The plastic and
	damage variables evolve normal to their respective surfaces which
	for plasticity corresponds to an associative flow for plastic strain.
	This general framework is shown to be sufficiently general to encompass
	several popular theories for plasticity and damage. Limitations of
	some existing damage theories are discussed. The performance of two
	specific coupled formulations are illustrated by replicating the
	experimental behavior of an aluminum alloy. },

	of soil behavior for small, nearly elastic, strains, while studies
	in soil statics have shed light on the plastic behavior and strength
	of soils. This paper attempts to synthesize information from soil
	dynamics and statics into a comprehensive three- dimensional effective
	stress-strain relation for soils, that will apply to static and dynamic,
	single or cyclic loadings of cohesionless or cohesive soils, accounting
	for inherent and stress induced anisotropy. A set of equations is
	presented that provide the general framework. Many of the details
	have been worked out, but others require further investigation. Some
	of the interrelationships between stress-dilatancy, critical state
	soil mechanics, work-hardening plasticilty, empirical equations for
	modulus and the hyperbolic stress-strain relation are demonstrated.
	Although an effective stress-strain relation is formulated, it is
	believed that it will ultimately be applied to undrained and partially
	drained soils. It is believed that the ulitimate solution to these
	problems lies in effective stress analysis. Of course, this does
	not diminish the importance of undrained strength analyses to current
	practice.},

	method on two types of planar disc packs. One is a very dense pack
	of mean coordination number 5.20 and the other of mean coordination
	number 4.0. Except for constraining the mean coordination number
	in the latter one, the different pack types were constructed by the
	same deposition process and had the same disc size distribution,
	for a fair statistical comparison. We show that the two types converge
	to limit statistics and that these limit statistics are different.
	We analyse the limit statistics and compare between both types of
	packs, demonstrating that the differences are directly related to
	the difference in the mean coordination numbers. We then find quantitatively
	the difference between the (inverse) compactivities of the two pack
	types: $${\frac{1}{X_{5.2}} - \frac{1}{X_{4}} = 1.5\pm 0.05}$$ .
	This explicit result supports strongly the validity of Edwards approach
	and underpins it as a useful tool to characterise granular systems
	quantitatively. In particular, it also paves the way to quantify
	the elusive compactivity.},

	a digital representation of a porous medium's microscopic pore geometry
	onto the size distributions for the pore bodies and pore throats
	and onto the coordination number of the network. This is accomplished
	by matching the morphological pore-size distribution and the genus
	of the network with those of the porous medium. The microscopic pore
	geometries were obtained by simulating random sphere packings, which
	match the grain-size distribution and the porosity of the experimental
	porous media. We obtained good agreement between simulated and measured
	hysteretic capillary pressure-saturation curves for three porous
	media. Correlations between pore-body and pore-throat sizes were
	important to achieve a realistic description of the simulated imbibition
	scanning curves.},

	In the dilation process an arbitrary shape is dilated by placing
	the center of a sphere of fixed diameter at every point in the basic
	shape. Defining a contact between two objects in this class is equivalent
	to determining which spheres amongst the infinite number that compose
	each object is in contact. The algorithm is derived for general ellipsoidal

	using a range of ellipsoidal particle shapes.},

  abstract = {A formulation of elastic–plastic theory for rate independent materials
	is described, based on the use of thermodynamic potentials. The four
	energy functions commonly used in thermodynamics (internal energy,
	Helmholtz free energy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy) are used to
	provide descriptions depending on which combinations of the stress,
	strain, temperature and entropy are taken as the independent variables.
	Much use is made of Legendre transformations to establish the links
	between the different energy functions. Dissipative behaviour is
	introduced through the use of kinematic internal parameters, and
	their conjugate variables, which are termed generalised stresses.
	A dissipation function or a yield function is used to describe the
	irreversible behaviour, and these are related by a degenerate case
	of the Legendre transformation. A central theme is that the constitutive
	behaviour is entirely determined by the knowledge of two scalar potentials.
	A systematic presentation is made of 16 possible ways of formulating
	constitutive behaviour within this framework. From four of these
	forms it is possible to establish the incremental response entirely
	by differentiation of the two potentials and by standard matrix manipulation.
	Examples are provided of the forms of the potentials for certain
	simple cases. The paper builds on previous work by Ziegler and other
	authors, and extends and generalises work by Collins and Houlsby
	to include thermal effects. },

  abstract = {According to their peculiar mechanical properties, the description
	of cellular materials is of high interest. Modelling aspects to be
	considered are, e.g. pronounced size depending boundary layer effects
	as well as a deformation-driven evolution of anisotropy or porosity.
	In the present contribution, we pay special attention to the description
	of size-dependent microtopological effects on the one hand. On the
	other hand, we focus on the relevance of extended continuum theories
	describing the local deformation state of microstructured materials.
	We, therefore, introduce a homogenization scheme for two-scale problems
	replacing a heterogeneous Cauchy continuum on the microscale by a
	homogeneous effective micromorphic continuum on the macroscale. The
	transitions between both scales are obtained by appropriate projection
	and homogenization rules which have to be derived, on the one hand,
	by kinematic assumptions, i.e. the minimization of the macroscopic
	displacement field, and, on the other hand, by energetic considerations,
	i.e. the evaluation of an extended Hill-Mandel condition.},

  abstract = {This is a critical review of the existing theories on characterizing
	the random packing of granular materials by means of entropy maximization.
	It is pointed out that the state density function, which specifies
	the limit-taking process and determines the asymptotic form of entropy,
	must be introduced in order to assure the invariance to parameter
	transformations. The entropy for the particle size distribution is
	first formulated, and an application to the void fraction distribution
	is illustrated. These examples show the relationship between the
	present entropy and those in information theory, statistical mechanics
	and thermodynamics. Then, a new viewpoint is presented; entropy is
	regarded as a measure of the ‘distance’ between statistical distributions.
	It is concluded that in this new sense the entropy provides a useful
	tool for the description of random quantities involved in granular
	materials.},

	homogenization is an extension of the classical first-order computational
	homogenization scheme and is based on a proper incorporation of the
	macroscopic gradient of the deformation tensor and the associated
	higher-order stress measure into the multiscale framework. The macroscopic
	homogenized continuum obtained through this scheme is the full second
	gradient continuum. It is demonstrated with several examples that
	the size of the microstructural RVE used in a second-order computational
	homogenization scheme may be related to the length scale of the associated
	macroscopic homogenized higher-order continuum. It is shown that
	the analytical second-order homogenization of a microstructurally
	homogeneous linearly elastic material leads to the second gradient
	elastic Mindlin's continuum on the macroscale, where the resulting
	macroscopic length scale parameter is proportional to the RVE size.
	Several numerical microstructural and multiscale analyses reveal
	the significance of the contribution of the physical and geometrical
	nonlinearities in the relation between the RVE size and the calculated

	for the modelling of microstructural size effects, is proposed within

	of granular media is presented. These formulations lead naturally
	to convex mathematical programs that can be solved using standard
	and readily available tools. In contrast to traditional discrete
	element analysis, the present granular contact dynamics formulation
	uses an implicit time discretization, thus allowing for large time
	steps. Moreover, in the limit of an infinite time step, the general
	dynamic formulation reduces to a static formulation that is useful
	in simulating common quasi-static problems such as triaxial tests
	and similar laboratory experiments. A significant portion of the
	paper is dedicated to exploring the consequences of the associated
	frictional sliding rule implied by the variational formulation adopted.
	In this connection, a new interior-point algorithm for general linear
	complementarity problems is developed and it is concluded that the
	associated sliding rule, in the context of granular contact dynamics,
	may be viewed as an artifact of the time discretization and that
	the use of an associated flow rule at the particle scale level generally

  journal = mofm,

  pages = {120 - 129},
  abstract = {In micromechanical studies of granular materials, relations are investigated
	between macro-level, continuum characteristics and micro-level, (inter)
	particle characteristics. For quasi-static deformation of granular
	materials, the fabric tensor is an important micromechanical characteristic
	that describes the orientational distribution of contacts between
	particles.
	
	The evolution of the fabric tensor during quasi-static deformation
	has been investigated, using two-dimensional Discrete Element Method
	simulations of constant-pressure tests of a dense and a loose isotropic
	initial assembly. Invariants of the fabric tensor are the coordination
	number, i.e. the average number of contacts per particle, and the
	fabric anisotropy, i.e. the difference between the principal values
	of the fabric tensor. At large strains, both coordination number
	and fabric anisotropy become constant. This constant value is the
	same for the dense and the loose initial assembly, i.e. a critical
	fabric state is attained. The evolution towards the critical state
	value for coordination number is much faster than for fabric anisotropy.
	
	The three micromechanical mechanisms through which the fabric tensor
	can change are contact creation, contact disruption and contact reorientation.
	Contact disruption is the dominant mechanism (except at the steady
	state) that is strongly anisotropic. The rate of contact disruption
	decreases rapidly with increasing imposed strain. Contact creation
	is approximately an isotropic mechanism. The rate of contact creation
	is fairly constant over the range of imposed strains. Fabric change
	due to contact reorientation is small, except at the steady state.
	
	An evolution relation is proposed for the changes in the fabric tensor
	as a function of the fabric tensor and the strain increment tensor.
	With its coefficients obtained by fitting with the data for the fabric
	tensor from the Discrete Element Method simulations, good agreement
	is observed between results from these simulations and from the proposed
	fabric-evolution relation.},

	in terms of the grain displacements and rotations for the two-dimensional
	case. It is based on a tessellation of the granular assembly into
	closed loops, along whose boundary the displacement field is defined
	in terms of the grain displacements and rotations. An important consideration
	for this expression is that it must satisfy the surface-additivity
	property, according to which the average displacement gradient of
	a combined two-dimensional surface is determined by the average displacement
	gradients of the constituent surfaces (and weighted by their areas).
	The developed micromechanical expression is verified by comparing
	its results with the macroscopic deformation as determined from the
	displacements at the boundary. Results of DEM simulations of a biaxial
	test (where the average rotation is equal to zero) and a shear test
	(where the average rotation is not equal to zero) are employed for
	this verification. The developed micromechanical expression for the
	displacement gradient is subsequently used to study deformation patterns
	in a complex case of a biaxial test where a shear band is formed.},

  pages = {63--80},
  abstract = {Abstract A flow model is developed for dense shear-driven granular
	flow. As described in the geomechanics literature, a critical state
	condition is reached after sufficient shearing beyond an initial
	static packing. During further shearing at the critical state, the
	stress, fabric, and density remain nearly constant, even as particles
	are being continually rearranged. The paper proposes a predictive
	framework for critical state flow, viewing it as a condition of maximum
	disorder at the micro-scale. The flow model is constructed in a two-dimensional
	setting from the probability density of the motions, forces, and
	orientations of inter-particle contacts. Constraints are applied
	to this probability density: constant mean stress, constant volume,
	consistency of the contact dissipation rate with the stress work,
	and the fraction of sliding contacts. The differential form of Shannon
	entropy, a measure of disorder, is applied to the density, and the
	Jaynes formalism is used to find the density of maximum disorder
	in the underlying phase space. The resulting distributions of contact
	force, movement, and orientation are compared with two-dimensional
	\{DEM\} simulations of biaxial compression. The model favorably predicts
	anisotropies of the contact orientations, contact forces, contact
	movements, and the orientations of those contacts undergoing slip.
	The model also predicts the relationships between contact force magnitude
	and contact motion. The model is an alternative to affine-field descriptions
	of granular flow. },

  abstract = {Abstract The rolling resistance between a pair of contacting particles
	can be modeled with two mechanisms. The first mechanism, already
	widely addressed in the \{DEM\} literature, involves a contact moment
	between the particles. The second mechanism involves a reduction
	of the tangential contact force, but without a contact moment. This
	type of rotational resistance, termed creep-friction, is the subject
	of the paper. Within the creep-friction literature, the term “creep”
	does not mean a viscous mechanism, but rather connotes a slight slip
	that accompanies rolling. Two extremes of particle motions bound
	the range of creep-friction behaviors: a pure tangential translation
	is modeled as a Cattaneo-Mindlin interaction, whereas prolonged steady-state
	rolling corresponds to the traditional wheel-rail problem described
	by Carter, Poritsky, and others. \{DEM\} simulations, however, are
	dominated by the transient creep-friction rolling conditions that
	lie between these two extremes. A simplified model is proposed for
	the three-dimensional transient creep-friction rolling of two spheres.
	The model is an extension of the work of Dahlberg and Alfredsson,
	who studied the two-dimensional interactions of disks. The proposed
	model is applied to two different systems: a pair of spheres and
	a large dense assembly of spheres. Although creep-friction can reduce
	the tangential contact force that would otherwise be predicted with
	Cattaneo-Mindlin theory, a significant force reduction occurs only
	when the rate of rolling is much greater than the rate of translational
	sliding and only after a sustained period of rolling. When applied
	to the deviatoric loading of an assembly of spheres, the proposed
	creep-friction model has minimal effect on macroscopic strength or
	stiffness. At the micro-scale of individual contacts, creep-friction
	does have a modest influence on the incremental contact behavior,
	although the aggregate effect on the assembly's behavior is minimal.

  abstract = {A method is presented for using DEM to find the pore pressure, total
	stress, and effective stress within a granular assembly during either
	undrained or drained conditions, by using poroelastic principles
	to directly determine the pore fluid pressure. The paper considers
	both the saturated and quasi-saturated conditions, the latter meaning
	a slightly unsaturated granular material, in which isolated gas bubbles
	reduce the compressibility of the pore fluid but do not form liquid
	bridges between the particles. The presence of air increases the
	pore fluid compressibility and is known to improve undrained strength
	and liquefaction resistance and has been considered for remediation
	of loose, susceptible soils. Past DEM studies have approximated undrained
	loading as a constant-volume condition, but this approximation does
	not allow the simulation of complex loading sequences, even with
	fully saturated materials. The paper’s method allows the direct control
	and measurement of total stress, water pressure, and water influx.
	The method includes the effects of water compressibility, grain compressibility,
	pore air compressibility, surface tension, air solubility within
	the pore liquid, and vapor pressure of the water gas phase. These
	factors all affect the evolving sizes of the bubbles and the consequent
	compressibility of the air–water mixture. The resulting algorithm
	is applied in three examples: the laboratory saturation of a soil
	specimen by increasing chamber pressure and back pressure, the undrained
	triaxial compression of quasi-saturated specimens, and the cyclic
	undrained triaxial liquefaction of quasi-saturated specimens. Example
	simulations agree favorably with laboratory tests.},

	granular materials consisting of dry particulate assemblages, a discrete
	particle-continuum model for modelling the coupled hydro-mechanical
	behaviour in saturated granular materials is developed. The motion
	of the interstitial fluid is described by two parallel continuum
	schemes governed by the averaged incompressible N-S equations and
	Darcy's law, respectively, where the latter one can be regarded as
	a degraded case of the former.Owing to the merits in both Lagrangian
	and mesh-free characters, the characteristic-based smoothed particle
	hydrodynamics (SPH) method is proposed in this paper for modelling
	pore fluid flows relative to the deformed solid phase that is modelled
	as packed assemblages of interacting discrete particles. It is assumed
	that the formulation is Lagrangian with the co-ordinate system transferring
	with the movement of the solid particles. The assumed continuous
	fluid field is discretized into a finite set of Lagrangian (material)
	points with their number equal to that of solid particles situated
	in the computational domain. An explicit meshless scheme for granular
	materials with interstitial water is formulated. Numerical results

  number = {14-15},
  abstract = {Information being dealt with in micro-mechanics is massive. Most of
	them are directional data. Macro-scale physical laws embedded with
	micro-scale fundamentals need to be developed in terms of the statistics
	of the micro-scale variable in a frame-indifferent form. Mathematical
	techniques and theories for characterizing the statistics of directional
	data with tensors are hence demanded. This is the main concern of
	the current paper. Starting with the general theory established in
	Kanatani (1984) of describing the directional distributions of orientations,
	mathematical formulations have been extended to address the directional
	distributions of vector-valued directional data, which is the most
	common data type being dealt with in micromechanical investigations.
	For vector-valued directional data, statistical analyses are required
	in regarding to both their directional probability density distribution
	and their representative values along each direction. The technique
	used here is to approximate these directional distributions by polynomials
	in unit directional vector n. The coefficients are in tensorial form
	and determined from observed directional data by applying the least
	square error criterion. These coefficient tensors serve as macro-scale
	variables representing the statistics of the micro-scale directional
	data, and are referred to as direction tensor. Orthogonal decompositions
	are addressed so that the coefficient tensor of different orders
	can be determined independently from each other. The coefficient
	tensors in the orthogonal decompositions are referred to as deviatoric
	direction tensor. The choice of sufficient approximation order is
	suggested. As an example, a general form of the stress-force-fabric
	relationship is derived for demonstrating the application of the
	proposed mathematical theory in the micro-mechanical investigation
	of the behaviour of granular materials. },

  pages = {1285 - 1302},
  number = {9},
  abstract = {This paper employed the theory of directional statistics to study
	the stress state of granular materials from the particle scale. The
	work was inspired by the stress-force-fabric relationship proposed
	by Rothenburg and Bathurst (1989), which represents a fundamental
	effort to establish analytical macro-micro relationship in granular
	mechanics. The micro-structural expression of the stress tensor σ
	ij = 1 V ∑ c ∈ V v i c f j c , where f i c is the contact force and
	v i c is the contact vector, was transformed into directional integration
	by grouping the terms with respect to their contact normal directions.
	The directional statistical theory was then employed to investigate
	the statistical features of contact vectors and contact forces. By
	approximating the directional distributions of contact normal density,
	mean contact force and mean contact vector with polynomial expansions
	in unit direction vector n , the directional dependences were characterized
	by the coefficients of the polynomial functions, i.e., the direction
	tensors. With such approximations, the directional integration was
	achieved by means of tensor multiplication, leading to an explicit
	expression of the stress tensor in terms of the direction tensors.
	Following the terminology used in Rothenburg and Bathurst (1989),
	the expression was referred to as the stress-force-fabric (SFF) relationship.
	Directional statistical analyses were carried out based on the particle-scale
	information obtained from discrete element simulations. The result
	demonstrated a small but isotropic statistical dependence between
	contact forces and contact vectors. It has also been shown that the
	directional distributions of contact normal density, mean contact
	forces and mean contact vectors can be approximated sufficiently
	by polynomial expansions in direction n up to 2nd, 3rd and 1st ranks,
	respectively. By incorporating these observations and revoking the
	symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor, the stress-force-fabric relationship
	was further simplified, while its capacity of providing nearly identical
	predictions of the stresses was maintained. The derived \{SFF\} relationship
	predicts the complete stress information, including the mean normal
	stress, the deviatoric stress ratio as well as the principal stress
	directions. The main benefits of deriving the stress-force-fabric
	relationship based on the directional statistical theory are: (1)
	the method does not involve space subdivision and does not require
	a large number of directional data; (2) the statistical and directional
	characteristics of particle-scale directional data can be systematically
	investigated; (3) the directional integration can be converted into
	and achieved by tensor multiplication, an attractive feature to conduct
	computer program aided analyses. },

  abstract = {In granular mechanics, macroscopic approaches treat a granular material
	as an equivalent continuum at macro-scale, and study its constitutive
	relationship between macro-quantities, such as stresses and strains.
	On the other hand, microscopic approaches consider a granular material
	as an assembly of individual particles interacting with each other
	at micro-scale (i.e., particle-scale), and the physical quantities
	under study are forces and displacements. This paper aims at linking
	up the findings from these two scales and to establish the macro-micro
	relations in granular mechanics. Three aspects of the macro-micro
	relations are investigated. They are about the internal structure,
	the stress tensor and the strain tensor. The internal structure is
	described with geometrical systems at the particle scale. Micro-structural
	definitions of the stress and strain tensors are derived, which link
	the macro-stress tensor with the contact forces, and the macro-strain
	tensor with the relative displacements at contact. In addition to
	a brief review of the past research work on these topics, further
	generalizations are made in this paper. In particular, the two cell
	systems proposed by Li and Li (2009), namely the solid cell system
	and the void cell system, are introduced and used for the derivation
	of the macro-structural expressions. The stress expression is derived
	based on Newton’s second law of motion. The result is valid for both
	static and dynamic cases. The strain expression is derived based
	on the compatibility requirement. And the expression is valid for
	any tessellation subdividing the granular assembly into polyhedral
	elements. The homogenization for deriving a macroscopic constitutive
	relationship from microscopic behaviour is discussed. Attention is
	placed on the macroscopic quantification of the internal structure
	in terms of a second rank tensor, known as the fabric tensor. Existing
	definitions of the fabric tensors have been reviewed. The correlations
	among different fabric tensors and their relations with the stress-strain
	behaviours have been investigated. },

  abstract = {This article presents a versatile, rigorous, and efficient methodology
	for extracting various geometric and topological parameters of 3D
	discrete porous media. The new approach takes advantage of the morphological
	skeleton of the pore structure—a lower dimensional representation
	of the pore space akin to the topological “deformation retract”.
	The skeleton is derived by a fully parallel thinning algorithm that
	fulfils two essential requirements: it generates a medial axis and
	preserves the connectivity of the pore space. Topological analysis
	is accomplished by classifying all skeleton points as node or link
	(branch) points according to the concept of λ-adjacency in 3D discrete
	space. In this manner, node coordination number and link length distributions
	are directly obtained from the skeleton. Pore necks (throats) are
	identified through a search for minima in the hydraulic radius of
	individual pore space channels outlined by skeleton links. In addition
	to the determination of the size distribution of the constrictions
	(pore necks) that control nonwetting phase invasion, improved estimates
	of the distributions of effective hydraulic and electric conductivity
	of individual pore space channels are obtained. Furthermore, erection
	of planes at the location of pore necks results in partitioning of
	the pore space into its constituent pores. This enables the characterization
	of the pore space in terms of a pore volume distribution. The new
	methodology is illustrated by application to a regular cubic pore
	network and irregularly shaped 2D and 3D pore networks generated
	by stochastic simulation. In the latter case, important new results
	are obtained concerning the sensitivity of geometric and topological
	properties of the microstructure to the parameters of stochastic
	simulation, namely, the porosity and correlation function. It is
	found that model porous media reconstructed from the same porosity
	and correlation function can exhibit marked differences in geometry
	and connectivity, which correlate with differences in specific surface
	area.},

	The distribution of averaged contact forces is assumed to depend
	not only on the macroscopic stress and the local orientation, but
	also on the value of the fabric tensor. In contrast to previous work,
	including the fabric tensor has the crucial advantage that accounts
	for all relative positions between interacting particles, through
	the average value of the branch tensor. Based on a classical representation
	result, we propose an identification procedure that uses information
	obtained from both isotropic and anisotropic configurations.},

  abstract = { In simulations of representative volume elements (RVEs) of materials
	with disordered microstructures, commonly used rigid and periodic
	boundary conditions (BCs) introduce additional constraints, causing:
	(i) boundary effects, (ii) unrealistic stiff response, (iii) artificial
	wavelengths in the solution fields, and (iv) suppression of solutions
	with localized deformation that otherwise may occur in the simulation.
	In this paper we define the minimal kinematic boundary conditions
	such that only the desired overall strain is imposed on the RVE,
	with no other undesirable constraints. We prove that such BCs result
	in a unique solution for the linear elastic case, and that the uniqueness
	for nonlinear problems is dependent on the pointwise positive definiteness
	of the incremental stiffness tensor. Upon incorporating the minimal
	BCs into the finite element framework, we consider, as an example,
	two-dimensional, linear elastic, disordered polycrystals and perform
	a systematic study of the effects of boundary conditions while varying
	the RVE size and controlling the sampling error. The results demonstrate
	that the minimal BCs, applicable to a RVE of any shape, are superior
	to other BCs, in that they give more realistic overall behaviour,
	reduce the required size of the RVE, and eliminate the superficial
	wavelengths in the solution field, ubiquitous in simulations with
	other boundary conditions. },

	of two- and three-dimensional patterns in terms of geometrical and
	topological descriptors. Based on concepts of integral geometry,
	it involves the calculation of the Minkowski functionals of black-and-white
	images representing the patterns. The result of this approach is
	an objective, numerical characterization of a given pattern. We briefly
	review the basic elements of morphological image processing, a technique
	to transform images to patterns that are amenable to further morphological
	image analysis. The image processing technique is applied to electron
	microscope images of nano-ceramic particles and metal-oxide precipitates.
	The emphasis of this review is on the practical aspects of the integral-geometry-based
	morphological image analysis but we discuss its mathematical foundations
	as well. Applications to simple lattice structures, triply periodic
	minimal surfaces, and the Klein bottle serve to illustrate the basic
	steps of the approach. More advanced applications include random
	point sets, percolation and complex structures found in block copolymers.

  abstract = {The paper presents a new method for quasi-static homogenization of
	granular microstructures and its embedding into two-scale simulations.
	On the coarse scale, a homogenized standard continuum is considered
	where the granular microstructures are locally attached at each point.
	These representative volumes are defined by aggregates of discrete
	solid particles, which may come into contact. On the micromechanical
	side, the interparticle contact mechanisms between particles is governed
	by a Coulomb-type frictional contact. In particular, elliptical-shaped
	plane particles are investigated. A consistent extension of classical
	stiff, soft and periodic boundary conditions from continuous to granular
	microstructures induce new classes of micro-to-macro transitions
	for granular aggregates. These include constraints not only for particle
	center displacements but also for particle rotations at a driving
	boundary frame. The stiff and soft constraints at the driving frame
	of the particle aggregate induce upper and lower bounds of the particle
	aggregate's stiffness. On the computational side, we outline a unified
	implementation of the displacement and rotational constraints by
	penalty methods that proves to be convenient for straightforward
	integration into discrete element codes. Representative numerical
	examples with elliptical-shaped particles are investigated, where
	the macroscopic stress responses for different boundary constraints
	are comparatively discussed. Finally, we embed the granular microstructures
	into a coarse graining discrete-to-finite element model, where they
	govern the micromechanical behavior of a two-scale simulation. Copyright

	a problem of interest with applications in many practical engineering
	problems. In this paper, we have further developed a micromechanical
	approach for obtaining the stress-displacement behavior of rough
	interfaces. The micromechanical approach considers the mechanics
	of asperity contacts and utilizes statistical description of interface
	roughness. Here we have focused upon the role of asperity contact
	orientations. To that end, we have incorporated asperity contact
	relative curvature distribution in our model and derived a relationship
	for the extent of asperity contact orientations in terms of the asperity
	contact relative curvature and interface closure. This relationship
	allows us to define the range of asperity contact orientation as
	the interface is subjected to combined normal and shear loading.
	We have consequently refined our stress-displacement relationship
	and its numerical evaluation procedure to include the asperity contact
	relative curvature distributions. We find that the asperity contact
	relative curvature has a significant effect on the extent of asperity
	contact orientation, and consequently on the shear behavior of the
	interface. We also find that the coupling between the normal and
	the shear responses, the interface frictional strength and the shear
	displacement hardening behavior are closely related to the extent
	of asperity contact orientations. },

	is the typical interparticle gap, and \fL is the typical stress induced
	by loads. Thus random packings of stiff particles are typically isostatic.
	Furthermore isostaticity is responsible for the anomalously large
	susceptibility to perturbation observed in granular aggregates. The

	distributed) in the isostatic limit, which means that slight overloads

  abstract = {A model of workhardening is proposed which generalizes the known rules
	of isotropic and kinematic workhardening by introducing the concept
	of a ‘field of workhardening moduli.’ This field is defined by a
	configuration of surfaces of constant workhardening moduli in the
	stress space. For any loading history the instantaneous configuration
	can be determined by calculating the translation and expansion or
	contraction of all surfaces; the material behaviour can thus be determined
	for complex loading paths, in particular for cyclic loadings. Several
	examples for a plane stress state are presented. },

  abstract = { In the current work, for the first time, the existence of a rolling
	moment of resistance of an adhesion bond between a microsphere and
	flat surface subjected to external dynamic force has been experimentally
	demonstrated. The rotational motion of spherical particles deposited
	on a wafer is excited in the 0-3.5 MHz range using a piezoelectric
	transducer. The approach is based on (i) the observation that the
	contribution of the rotational (rocking) motion to the axial displacement
	of the particle are few orders of magnitude higher than those of
	the purely axial motion and (ii) the existence of a relationship
	between the rotational natural frequency of the adhesion bond and
	the work of adhesion. The natural frequency of the rotational (rocking)
	motion is extracted from the low frequency components of the transient
	response of the particle in the axial direction, which is measured
	by a laser interferometer. The existing theoretical adhesion models
	for rolling resistance moment are evaluated using the experimental
	results. Good agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental
	values is found. },

  abstract = {High velocity (1 m/s) friction experiments on bituminous coal gouge
	display several earthquake-related phenomena, including devolatilization
	by frictional heating, gas pressurization, and slip weakening. Stage
	I is characterized by sample shortening and reduction in the coefficient
	of friction (μ) from ∼ 1 to 0.6. Stage \{II\} is characterized by
	high frequency (∼ 5 Hz) oscillations in stress and strain records
	and by gas emissions. Stage \{III\} is marked by rapid weakening
	(μ ∼ 0.1 to 0.35) and sample shortening, together with continued
	gas emissions. Stage \{IV\} produces stable stress records and continued
	weakness (μ ∼ 0.2), but without gas emission. Stage I shortening
	is due to compaction of the gouge and the weakening is attributed
	to mechanical or thermal effects. Stage \{II\} behavior is interpreted
	as due to coal gasification and fluctuations in fluid pressure, resulting
	in high frequency stick-slip type behavior. Dramatic reduction in
	shear stress in stage \{III\} is attributed to gas pressurization
	by pore collapse and corresponds to a frictional instability, analogous
	to nucleation of an earthquake. Microstructural observations indicate
	the deformation was brittle during stages I and \{II\} but ductile
	during stages \{III\} and IV. Time dependent finite element frictional
	heat models indicate the center of the samples became hot (∼ 900 °C)
	during stage II, whereas the edge of samples remained relatively
	cold (&lt;&#xa0;300 °C). Vitrinite reflectance of coal samples shows
	an increase in reflectance from ∼ 0.5 to ∼ 0.8% over the displacement
	interval 20-40 m (20-40 s), indicating that the reflectance responds
	to frictional heating on a short time scale. The energy expended
	per unit area in these low stress, large displacement experiments
	is similar to that of higher stress (∼ 50 MPa), short displacement
	(∼ 1 m) earthquakes (∼ 107 J/m2). },

  journal = ijnamg,

  volume = {27},
  pages = {859--877},
  number = {10},
  abstract = {Discrete element modelling is a viable alternative to conventional
	continuum-based analysis for analysing problems involving localized
	deformations of particulate media. However, to aid in the interpretation
	of the results, it is useful to express the results of discrete element
	analyses in terms of the continuum parameters of stress and strain.
	A number of homogenization methods have been proposed to calculate
	strain in discrete systems; however, two significant limitations
	of these methods remain. First, none of these methods incorporate
	particle rotation effects satisfactorily, although significant particle
	rotation occurs in shear bands in both physical tests and numerical
	simulations of granular materials. Additionally, observations of
	the particle displacement fields in shear bands in granular materials
	indicate that the displacements within the localizations are erratic.
	Consequently, existing linear, local interpolation approaches produce
	substantial variations in the strain values calculated in adjacent
	elements in the region of localization, hindering clear visualization
	of the strain localization as it evolves. A new method of domain
	discretization for calculating strain is proposed. This method is
	capable of capturing particle rotation and employs a non-local meshfree
	interpolation procedure capable of smoothing the erratic displacements
	in strain localizations, which better defines their evolution. The
	proposed method is validated for problems involving both two and
	three dimensions. A number of methods are compared with the proposed
	method and pertinent insights are made. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley

  abstract = {The material spatial randomness forces one to re-examine various basic
	concepts of continuum solid mechanics. In this paper we focus on
	the Representative Volume Element (RVE) that is commonly taken for
	granted in most of deterministic as well as in stochastic solid mechanics,
	although in the latter case it is called the Statistical Volume Element
	(SVE). The key issue is the scale over which homogenization is being
	carried out—it is called the mesoscale, separating the microscale
	(level of microheterogeneities) from the macroscale (level of RVE).
	As the mesoscale grows, the \{SVE\} tends to become the RVE. This
	occurs in terms of two hierarchies of bounds stemming from Dirichlet
	and Neumann boundary value problems on the mesoscale, respectively.
	Since generally there is no periodicity in real random media, the
	\{RVE\} can only be approached approximately on finite scales. We
	review results on this subject in the settings of linear elasticity,
	finite elasticity, plasticity, viscoelasticity, thermoelasticity,
	and permeability.},

  abstract = {This work describes a homogenization-based multi-scale procedure required
	for the computation of the material response of non-linear microstructures
	undergoing small strains. Such procedures are important for computer
	modelling of heterogeneous materials when the length-scale of heterogeneities
	is small compared to the dimensions of the body. The described multi-scale
	procedure relies on a unified variational basis which, apart from
	the continuum-based variational formulation at both micro- and macroscales
	of the problem, also includes the variational formulation governing
	micro-to-macro transitions. This unified variational basis leads
	naturally to a generic finite element-based framework for homogenization-based
	multi-scale analysis of heterogenous solids. In addition, the unified
	variational formulation provides clear axiomatic basis and hierarchy
	related to the choice of boundary conditions at the microscale. Classical
	kinematical constraints are considered over the representative volume
	element: (i) Taylor, (ii) linear boundary displacements, (iii) periodic
	boundary displacement fluctuations and (iv) minimal constraint, also
	known as uniform boundary tractions. In this context the Hill-Mandel
	averaging requirement, which links microscopic and macroscopic stress
	power, plays a fundamental role in defining the microscopic forces
	compatible with the assumed kinematics. Numerical examples of both
	microscale and two-scale finite element simulations of elasto-plastic
	material with microcavities are presented to illustrate the main
	features and scope of the described computational strategy. Copyright

	given point to the solution set of a system of linear equations.
	This is also a direct method for solving systems of linear equations.
	The output of the method is either the projection or inconsistency
	of the system. Moreover, in the process also linearly dependent equations
	are recognized. This paper is constrained for giving theoretical
	foundations, computational complexity and some numerical experiments
	with dense matrices although the method allows to employ sparsity.
	The raw method could not compete with best software packages in solving
	linear equations for general matrices, but it was competitive in
	finding projections for matrices with small number of rows relative
	to the number of columns.},

  abstract = {This paper builds on previous work by Houlsby and Puzrin (Int. J.
	Plasticity 16 (2000) 1017) in which a framework was set out for the
	derivation of rate-independent plasticity theory from thermodynamic
	considerations. A key feature of the formalism is that the entire
	constitutive response is determined by knowledge of two scalar functions.
	The loading history is effectively captured through the use of internal
	variables. In this paper, we extend the concept of internal variables
	to that of internal functions, which represent infinite numbers of
	internal variables. In this case the thermodynamic functions are
	replaced by functionals. We set out the formalism necessary to derive
	constitutive behaviour within this approach. The principal advantages
	of this development is that it can provide realistic modelling of
	kinematic hardening effects and smooth transitions between elastic
	and elastic–plastic behaviour. },

	response of materials. Part I (see Rajagopal and Srinivasa, 1998
	International Journal of Plasticity 14, 945–967) dealt with the structure
	of the constitutive equations for the elastic response of a material
	with multiple natural configurations. We now focus attention on the
	evolution of the natural configurations. We introduce two functions-the
	Helmholtz potential and the rate of dissipation function—representing
	the rate of conversion of mechanical work into heat. Motivated by,
	and generalizing the work of Ziegler (1963) in Progress in Solid
	Mechanics, Vol. 4, North-Holland, Amsterdam/New York; (1983) An Introduction
	to Thermodynamics, North-Holland, Amsterdam/New York) we then assume
	that the evolution of the natural configurations occurs in such a
	way that the rate of dissipation is maximized. This maximization
	is subject to the constraint that the rate of dissipation is equal
	to the difference between the rate of mechanical working and the
	rate of increase of the Helmholtz potential per unit volume. This
	then allows us to derive the constitutive equations for the stress
	response and the evolution of the natural configurations from these
	two scalar functions. Of course, the maximum rate of dissipation
	criterion that is stated here is only an assumption that holds for
	a certain class of materials under consideration. Our quest is to
	see whether such an assumption gives reasonable results. In the process,
	we hope to gain insight into the nature of such materials. We demonstrate
	that the resulting constitutive equations allow for response with
	and without yielding behavior and obtain a generalization of the
	normality and convexity conditions. We also show that, in the limit
	of quasistatic deformations, if one considers materials that possess
	yielding behavior, then the constitutive equations reduce to those
	corresponding to the strain space formulation of the rate independent
	theory of plasticity (see e.g. Naghdi (1990) Journal of Applied Mathematics
	and Physics A345, 425–458.). Moreover, in this limit, the maximum
	rate of dissipation criterion, as stated here, is equivalent to the
	work inequality of Naghdi and Trapp (1975) Quartely Journal of Mechanics
	and Applied Mathematics 28, 25–46). The main results together with
	an illustrative example are presented. },

  abstract = {Field observations of mature crustal faults suggest that slip in individual
	events occurs primarily within a thin shear zone, <1-5 mm, within
	a finely granulated, ultracataclastic fault core. Relevant weakening
	processes in large crustal events are therefore suggested to be thermal,
	and to involve the following: (1) thermal pressurization of pore
	fluid within and adjacent to the deforming fault core, which reduces
	the effective normal stress and hence also the shear strength for
	a given friction coefficient and (2) flash heating at highly stressed
	frictional microcontacts during rapid slip, which reduces the friction
	coefficient. (Macroscopic melting, or possibly gel formation in silica-rich
	lithologies, may become important too at large enough slip.) Theoretical
	modeling of mechanisms 1 and 2 is constrained with lab-determined
	hydrologic and poroelastic properties of fault core materials and
	lab friction studies at high slip rates. Predictions are that strength
	drop should often be nearly complete at large slip and that the onset
	of melting should be precluded over much (and, for small enough slip,
	all) of the seismogenic zone. A testable prediction is of the shear
	fracture energies that would be implied if actual earthquake ruptures
	were controlled by those thermal mechanisms. Seismic data have been
	compiled on the fracture energy of crustal events, including its
	variation with slip in an event. It is plausibly described by theoretical
	predictions based on the above mechanisms, within a considerable
	range of uncertainty of parameter choices, thus allowing the possibility
	that such thermal weakening prevails in the Earth.},

  abstract = {This paper is a study of the theoretical foundations of constitutive
	relations at finite strain for a class of solids exhibiting inelasticity
	as a consequence of specific structural rearrangements, on the microscale,
	of constituent elements of material. Metals deforming plastically
	through dislocation motion are of this class and form the primary
	application of the theory. The development is in terms of a general
	internal-variable thermodynamic formalism for description of the
	microstructural rearrangements, and it is shown how metal plasticity
	may be so characterized. The principal result is in the normality
	structure which is shown to arise in macroscopic constitutive laws
	when each of the local microstructural rearrangements proceeds at
	a rate governed by its associated thermodynamic force. This provides
	a theoretical framework for time-dependent inelastic behavior in
	terms of a “flow potential”, and reduces to statements on normality
	of strain increments to yield surfaces in the time-independent case.
	Conventional characterizations of the stress-state dependence of
	metallic slip are noted to be in accord with this concept of associated
	forces governing rates, so that the resulting normality structure
	may be considered directly applicable to metal plasticity. },

  abstract = {In quantitative image analysis, Minkowski functionals are becoming
	standard parameters for topological and geometrical measurements.
	Nevertheless, they are limited to binary images or to sections of
	gray-tone images and are achieved in a global and monoscale way.
	The use of General Adaptive Neighborhoods (GANs) enables to overcome
	these limitations. The GANs are spatial neighborhoods defined around
	each point of the spatial support of a gray-tone image, according
	to three (GAN) axiomatic criteria: a criterion function (luminance,
	contrast, ...), an homogeneity tolerance with respect to this criterion,
	and an algebraic model for the image space. Thus, the GANs are simultaneously
	adaptive with the analyzing scales, the spatial structures and the
	image intensities. This paper aims to introduce the GAN-based Minkowski
	functionals, which allow a gray-tone image analysis to be realized
	in a local, adaptive and multiscale way. The Minkowski functionals
	are computed on the GAN of each point of the spatial support of a
	gray-tone image, enabling to define the so-called Minkowski maps
	by assigning the Minkowski functional value to each point. The histograms
	of these maps provide a statistical distribution of the topology
	and geometry of the gray-tone image structures, and not only of the
	image intensities. The impact of the GAN characteristics, as well
	as the impact of multiscale transformations, are analyzed in a qualitative
	global and local way through these GAN-based Minkowski maps and histograms.
	This multiscale image analysis is illustrated on the test image 'Lena'
	and also applied in both the biomedical and materials areas.},

	in a computer program used to simulate the performance of idealized
	granular systems composed of elliptical-shaped particles. The work
	is an extension of numerical simulation methods which have been successfully
	used in micromechanics research on disk-shaped or polygon-shaped
	particles by the authors and others. The simulation of elliptical-shaped
	particles offers the possibility to explore the influence of particle
	shape on the micromechanical behaviour of plane assemblies of particles
	and the stress-strain behaviour of these systems at the macro scale.
	Typical results of simulation runs are presented to illustrate the
	importance of particle shape on the macroscopic stress-strain response
	of plane systems.},

	and complex geometry of the grains. Numerical models based on discrete
	element modeling provides an opportunity to understand these phenomena
	while considering the discrete elements with a similar shape to that
	of the grains the soil is composed of. However, dealing with realistic
	shapes would lead to a prohibitive calculation cost. In a macroscopic
	modeling approach, simplification of the discrete elements? shape
	can be done as long as the model can predict experimental results.
	Since the intrinsic non-convex geometry property of real grains seems
	to play a major role on the response of the granular medium, it is
	thus possible to keep this geometrical feature by using cluster of
	spherical discrete elements, which has the advantage to reduce dramatically
	the computation cost. Since the porosities found experimentally could
	not always be obtained with the numerical model?owing to the huge
	difference in shape, the notion of relative density, which requires
	a search for minimum and maximum porosities for the model, was chosen
	to compare the experimental and numerical results. Comparing the
	numerical simulations with the experimental triaxial tests conducted
	with relative densities and different confining pressures shows that
	the model is able to predict the experimental results.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a micromechanical study of unsaturated
	granular media in the pendular regime, based on numerical experiments
	using the discrete element method, compared with a microstructural
	elastoplastic model. Water effects are taken into account by adding
	capillary menisci at contacts and their consequences in terms of
	force and water volume are studied. Simulations of triaxial compression
	tests are used to investigate both macro and micro-effects of a partial
	saturation. The results provided by the two methods appear to be
	in good agreement, reproducing the major trends of a partially saturated
	granular assembly, such as the increase in the shear strength and
	the hardening with suction. Moreover, a capillary stress tensor is
	exhibited from capillary forces by using homogenization techniques.
	Both macroscopic and microscopic considerations emphasize an induced
	anisotropy of the capillary stress tensor in relation with the pore
	fluid distribution inside the material. Insofar as the tensorial
	nature of this fluid fabric implies shear effects on the solid phase
	associated with suction, a comparison has been made with the standard
	equivalent pore pressure assumption. It is shown that water effects
	induce microstructural phenomena that cannot be considered at the
	macro level, particularly when dealing with material history. Thus,
	the study points out that unsaturated soil stress definitions should
	include, besides the macroscopic stresses such as the total stress,
	the microscopic interparticle stresses such as the ones resulting
	from capillary forces, in order to interpret more precisely the implications
	of the pore fluid on the mechanical behaviour of granular materials.

	only on the moments of the particle-size distribution. Similar results

  abstract = {Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) of cyclic behavior of granular material
	has been attempted to understand liquefaction behavior of sands.
	A series of cyclic biaxial tests in both undrained and drained conditions
	with constant stress and strain amplitudes were performed on assemblage
	of loose and dense systems. Tests are conducted on monodisperse (uniform)
	and polydisperse (well graded) samples. From this study, it has been
	shown that DEM can simulate the cyclic behavior of sands very satisfactorily.
	Characteristic features, i.e., occurrence of large plastic strains
	and changing over from contractile to dilative behavior beyond the
	phase transformation angle, anisotropy of reduced strength on the
	extension side etc are very well reflected in numerical simulations.
	Liquefaction of loose assemblage seems to be mainly due to continued
	and cumulative loss of co-ordination number under each cycle as there
	is a reversal of loading direction and hence a continuous reorientation
	of fabric. There is no cumulative loss of co-ordination number in
	dense states because the stress ratios are mostly higher than the
	phase transformation level where the fabric has reached a limiting
	orientation. Micro mechanical explanations to the macroscopic behavior
	of the disc assemblage under cyclic loading are presented in terms
	of the force and fabric anisotropy coefficients.},

  abstract = {Discrete element modeling is employed to investigate the micromechanics
	of two granular assemblies subjected to constant-volume cyclic loading.
	For this purpose, two assemblies of spherical particles are modeled
	at the same confining pressure but with two different void ratios.
	The cyclic behaviors of the assemblies are inspected and the micromechanical
	parameters and their variations during cyclic loading are carefully
	observed and analyzed. The evolution of contact force networks with
	the progression of the loading cycles confirms that the contact force
	networks are hysteretic and their formation depends on the previous
	strain conditions of the assemblies. The distributions of the contact
	normals and their normal forces are also investigated to obtain a
	quantitative insight of the changes in the contact force networks.
	The probability distributions of the normal and tangential forces
	during cyclic loading are similar to the results of previous experimental
	studies that were conducted on two-dimensional specimens of granular
	materials. In addition, variations of the fabric tensors, which were
	calculated for strong contacts, are studied to trace the changes
	of the structural anisotropy of the specimens. The results suggest
	that the structural anisotropy of the specimens increases dramatically
	when they approach the state of liquefaction and that the degree
	of anisotropy is more profound in the strong contacts. Finally, the
	displacements of the particles during specific loading cycles are
	calculated to determine the relation between the movements of the
	particles and the changes in the macro-scale behavior of the two
	assemblies. The results of this study elaborate the origin of liquefaction
	phenomena with respect to the microstructure of the granular soils,
	showing the role of different mode of contacts failure in micro-scale
	(sliding and rolling) on the overall observed behavior of granular
	soils with two different relative densities, moreover the importance
	of strong and weak contacts in cyclic constant-volume loading of
	the media. It also emphasizes on the variation of structural anisotropy
	in undrained cyclic loading of granular media and its relationship
	with common soil behavior in macro-scale during liquefaction failure.},

	the sensitivity of these three properties to the particle size distribution
	is assessed. An investigation is made in which smaller particles
	in an \{RVE\} were replaced by larger ones while the aggregate density

  abstract = {The paper presents results of periodic cell simulations on a polydisperse
	system of 27 000 elastic spheres. In order to explore general three-dimensional
	stress space an initially isotropically compressed system is subjected
	to radial deviatoric strain paths and the corresponding stress and
	fabric responses are illustrated. It is shown that two parameters
	can be identified that characterise the stress and fabric respectively
	during general three-dimensional straining. Each parameter, when
	plotted against deviatoric strain, provides a unique evolution curve,
	irrespective of the loading direction. It is demonstrated that, for
	general states of stress, the magnitude of the deviatoric stress
	is entirely due to the strong force chains that constitute the sub-network
	of contacts transmitting greater than average contact forces. It
	is also demonstrated that the relationship between the Lode angle
	for stress and the Lode angle for strain can be characterised by
	the curvature of a circular arc and, for radial deviatoric straining,
	this constitutes a flow rule that defines the relationship between
	the directions of the stress and strain-rate vectors. Furthermore,
	by plotting the characteristic stress parameter against the curvature
	of the circular arc flow rule, a simple scaling law is obtained.},

  abstract = {We examine emergent, self-organized particle cluster conformations
	in quasistatically deforming dense granular materials from the perspective
	of structural stability. A structural mechanics approach is employed,
	first, to devise a new stability measure for such conformations in
	equilibrium and, second, to use this measure to explore the evolving
	stability of jammed states of specific cluster conformations, i.e.
	particles forming force chains and minimal contact cycles. Knowledge
	gained on (a) the spatial and temporal evolution of stability of
	individual jammed conformations and (b) their relative stability
	levels, offer valuable clues on the rheology and, in particular,
	self-assembly of granular materials. This study is undertaken using
	data from assemblies of nonuniformly sized circular particles undergoing
	2D deformation in two biaxial compression tests: a discrete element
	simulation of monotonic loading under constant confining pressure,
	and cyclic loading of a photoelastic disk assembly under constant
	volume. Our results suggest that the process of self-assembly in
	these systems is realized at multiple length scales, and that jammed
	force chains and minimal cycles form the basic building blocks of
	this process. In particular, 3-cycles are stabilizing agents that
	act as granular trusses to the load-bearing force chain columns.
	This co-evolutionary synergy between force chains and 3-cycles proved
	common to the different materials under different loading conditions.
	Indeed, the remarkable similarities in the evolution of stability,
	prevalence and persistence of minimal cycles and force chains in
	these systems suggest that these structures and their co-evolution
	together form a generic feature of dense granular systems under quasistatic
	loading.},

  abstract = {The connectivity of pore space is an important topological property
	of soil. Together with the porosity and the pore-size distribution,
	it governs the transport of water, solutes and gases. This paper
	describes the Euler-Poincaré characteristic (EPC) as an index of
	connectivity of soil pore space in three dimensions, and shows how
	the \{EPC\} can be estimated by analysing pairs of parallel images,
	so-called disectors, automatically. We investigated the connectivity
	of pores &gt; 50 μm within two horizons of a Terra fusca from serial
	surfaces through undisturbed soil impregnated with resin. A method
	is proposed for the segmentation of the grey level images into solid
	and void which is especially suitable for the detection of the pore
	edges. This results in identification of topologically distinct features.
	The 3D \{EPC\} was estimated from pairs of adjacent surfaces, the
	disector, using an algorithm to count the topological features by
	digital image processing. The \{EPC\} from 10 adjacent disectors
	within the two horizons are significantly different, and confirm
	qualitative observations of more intensely connected pore space in
	the upper Ah horizon. Additional results from 100 adjacent disectors
	in the lower AhBv horizon show the continuous evolution of the \{EPC\}
	estimates over a distance of 5 mm where two different scales of variation
	can be distinguished clearly: a small-scale variation which is attributed
	to methodological errors and a large scale variation reflecting the
	variability of the structure. },

	granular materials were conducted to analyze how the interactions

	under various suction pressure and loading histories. To study how
	the formation and rupture of liquid bridges affect the mechanical
	responses of wetted granular materials, a series of suction-controlled
	triaxial tests were conducted with two grain assemblies, one composed
	of large particles of similar sizes, the other composed of a mixture
	of large particles with significant amount of fines. The results
	indicate that capillary stresses are anisotropic in both sets of
	specimens, and that stress anisotropy is more significant in granular
	assemblies filled with fine particles. A generalized tensorial Bishop’s
	coefficient is introduced to analyze the connections between microstructural
	attributes and macroscopic responses. Numerical simulations presented
	in this paper indicate that the principal values and directions of
	this Bishop’s coefficient tensor are path dependent.},

	were conducted to examine the effect of particle size ratio and the
	ratio of volume fraction comprising small particles to the volume
	of all spheres (volume fraction) on geometrical properties of binary
	granular mixtures. The size ratio was chosen not smaller than 0.4
	to prevent small particles from percolating through bedding and be
	trapped in the tetrahedron or octahedron made with large contacting
	spheres. Both, numerical tests and experiments showed an increase
	in the influence of the volume fraction of small particles on packing
	density in binary mixtures with an increasing ratio between small
	and large particles' diameters. In packings with the particle size
	ratio not larger than 0.7, the solid fraction reached maximum when
	the volume fraction of small spheres was 0.6, which was not observed
	in samples with higher degree of particle size homogeneity. The average
	coordination number and packing density followed the same paths with
	the increasing contribution of small particles in mixtures, indicating
	a strong relationship between parameters. Detailed analysis of the
	coordination numbers for contacts between different types of particles
	showed that, average coordination number in binary mixtures was determined
	mainly by contacts between large and small particles. The composition
	of bidisperse samples was also found to strongly affect their spatial
	structure described in this study by means of the radial distribution

	behave much as real world objects and propose a system based on a
	new class of volumetric models, called superquadrics. These functions
	have significant advantages for calculating multibody interactions,
	and by coupling volumetric representation to a modal decomposition
	method for the physical dynamics we have been able to gain up to
	two orders of magnitude in efficiency. The modal method allows us
	to trade off high order modes for improved stability, time step magnitude,
	temporal aliasing and speed of response, and so provide almost real
	time feedback to the designer. We believe that virtual manufacturing
	systems will be especially useful in conceptual design, in design
	for manufacture and in the new thrust in concurrent design.},

  abstract = {The appearance of shear banding in granular materials has been investigated
	intensively during the last decades and is still of ongoing importance
	in terms of understanding the stress-strain behaviour of the material,
	the localization phenomena and the interaction between soil and structure.
	Only less attention has been paid to the occurrence of systems of
	shear bands although such systems can be identified in geotechnical
	structures as well as in geological formations. In this paper we
	present results of experiments on sand specimens under extensional
	load in natural gravity as well as in increased gravity in the centrifuge
	where the influence of the stress level on the geometry of a shear
	band pattern, specified by the spacing of the shear bands and the
	angle between failure surfaces and minor stress direction, has been
	investigated. X-ray technique has been used to visualize the failure
	zones inside the specimen, an optical measurement system called Digital
	Image Correlation has been applied to identify and observe the appearing
	deformation mechanism on the sides of the specimens in natural gravity
	as well as during the flight in the centrifuge. It can be shown that
	the geometry of the shear band pattern is sparsely influenced by
	the change of the stress level. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons,

  abstract = {This paper presents three series of sandbox experiments of extensional
	deformation in granular material. The dependence of the developing
	shear band system on different boundary conditions and material properties
	is investigated: (1) granulometric properties of the material, (2)
	initial geometry of the specimen, and (3) dynamic material parameters.
	Particular attention is paid to the controlling of the basal boundary
	conditions. X-ray technique and particle image velocimetry (PIV)
	are used to study the changes in the granular structure and in the
	formation of shear band patterns. The results show that boundary
	conditions are an elaborate factor to explain differences in the
	shear band pattern. It is shown that neither the average grain size
	diameter d50 nor the rate of loading influences the shear band spacing.
	The spacing of the bands seems to be linearly dependent on the initial
	height of the specimen. },

  abstract = {The concept of the critical state in granular soils needs to make
	proper reference to the fabric structure that develops at critical
	state. This study identifies a unique property associated with the
	fabric structure relative to the stresses at critical state. A unique
	relationship between the mean effective stress and a fabric anisotropy
	parameter, K, defined by the first joint invariant of the deviatoric
	stress tensor and the deviatoric fabric tensor, is found at critical
	state, and is path-independent. Numerical simulations using the discrete-element
	method under different loading conditions and intermediate principal
	stress ratios identify a unique power law for this relationship.
	Based on the findings, a new definition of critical state for granular
	media is proposed. In addition to the conditions of constant stress
	and unique void ratio required by the conventional critical state
	concept, the new definition imposes the additional constraint that
	K reaches a unique value at critical state. A unique spatial critical
	state curve in the three-dimensional space K-e-p′ is found for a
	granular medium, the projection of which onto the e-p′ plane turns
	out to be the conventional critical state line. The new critical
	state concept provides an important reference state for a soil to
	reach, based on which the key concepts in the constitutive modelling
	of granular media, including the choice of state parameters, dilatancy
	relation and non-coaxiality, are reassessed, and future exploratory
	topics are discussed.},
